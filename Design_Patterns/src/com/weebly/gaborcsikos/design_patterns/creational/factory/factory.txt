Intent:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Use the Factory pattern when:
• a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
• a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
• classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want
to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

Benefits:
Provides hooks for subclasses.
Connects parallel class hierarchies

Examples:
java.util.Calendar#getInstance()
java.util.ResourceBundle#getBundle()
java.text.NumberFormat#getInstance()
