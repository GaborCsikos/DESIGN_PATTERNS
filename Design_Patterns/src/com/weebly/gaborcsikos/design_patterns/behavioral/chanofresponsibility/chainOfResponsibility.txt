Intent:
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the
chain until an object handles it.

Use the Chain of responsibility pattern when:
• more than one object may handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori.
The handler should be ascertained automatically.
• you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the
receiver explicitly.
• the set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically.

Benefits:
Reduced coupling.
Added flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects.
Receipt isn't guaranteed.

Examples:
java.util.logging.Logger#log()
javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()
