Intent:
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with
different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Use the Command pattern when you want to:
• parameterize objects by an action to perform
• specify, queue, and execute requests at different times.
• support undo.
• support logging.
• structure a system around high-level operations built on primitives operations.
Such a structure is common in information systems that support transactions

Benefits:
Explained in the use Command section

Examples:
All implementations of java.lang.Runnable
All implementations of javax.swing.Action
