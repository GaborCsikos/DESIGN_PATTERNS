Intent:
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that
the object can be restored to this state later.

Use the Memento pattern when

• a snapshot of (some portion of) an object's state must be saved so that it can be
restored to that state later, and
• a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and
break the object's encapsulation.

Benefits:
Preserving encapsulation boundaries.
It simplifies Originator.
Using mementos might be expensive.
Defining narrow and wide interfaces.
Hidden costs in caring for mementos.

Examples:
java.util.Date (the setter methods do that, Date is internally represented by a long value)
All implementations of java.io.Serializable
All implementations of javax.faces.component.StateHolder
